## Distributed-Database 

*Three nodes containing 4 databases are connected.The connection is made in a way that data can be transmitted over the nodes as per the employees‚Äô wish; asynchronously (updating data to local nodes via the headquarter) or synchronously (updating data on all nodes at the same time).*

1. Create a database `financial&cost_accounts` on `localhost/127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin` on the headquarter node.
2. Click `Import` and choose `financial_cost_account.sql` file in SQL folder to create database.
3. Similarly create the other databases on different nodes with the naming conventions as of `folders`
4. Extract the folder in `xampp` --> `htdocs`
5. Establish Connections
6. Run `localhost\foldername\index.php` on the browser in headquater node. `Insert.php` in other nodes.
